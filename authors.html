                <h1>Hunter S. Thompson</h1>
            </a>
            <p>Hunter S. Thompson (1937 - 2005) was an iconic American, the father of Gonzo journalism, revolutionary
                critic of the political establishment, the greatest writer of drug experience, the ultimate first person
                maniac. He lived a mad life and he wrote about it. He didn't sit on the sidelines and observe, he got
                stuck right in. He wanted to write about the Hell's Angels, so he joined the Hell's Angels. Nobody
                inspired me more to grab life by the balls and live it.

                <h1> Haruki Murakami</h1>
            </a>
            <p>Haruki Murakami (b. 1949) is a cult icon as well as a populist success. His books are melancholy, slow
                and odd. He digs deep into the male psyche to make cleverly crafted tales of loneliness, introspection
                and fantasy. I first read Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage and became completely
                addicted to his fiction. Once I read What I Talk About When I Talk About Running I was completely sold
                on one of the world's most famous modern authors.

                <h1>Gabriel García Márquez</h1>
            </a>
            <p>Gabriel García Márquez (1927 - 2014) was largely obscure to me for many years. I had heard of One Hundred
                Years of Solitude but avoided it due it's supposed obscurity and difficulty. When I eventually decided
                to take the plunge, I was completely absorbed into a fantastical magic realism world. The characters,
                the dialogue, the descriptions...every page was an absolute joy. I went on to read many more of his
                stories, each as beautiful as the last.</p>

            </a>
            <p>Arthur Conan Doyle (1859 - 1930) created the most famous detective of all time, Sherlock Holmes. In my
                mid to late teens I became utterly obsessed with the short stories featuring Holmes and Watson and
                devoured every single one. I read them and re-read them picking out every nuance, every clue that Doyle
                gave the reader and tried to deduce the answer myself. Sherlock was an inspiration character of
                intelligence and wit and I loved every descriptive word about him.</p>
