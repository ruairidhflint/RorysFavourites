                <h1>Breaking Bad</h1>
            </a>
            <p>Breaking Bad (2008 - 2013) is the greatest TV Show to air. Game of Thrones was fantastic but nothing on Breaking Bad. The story of a genius chemist who is stuck in a life of mediocrity as a science teacher, diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, turns to drug creating and dealing to provide a life after his death for his family. Things escalate. Bryan Cranston puts in one of the best performances I have ever seen in any medium. It will never get old.

                <h1> Peep Show</h1>
            </a>
            <p>Peep Show (2003 - 2015) is a British sitcom following the tragically mundane lives of flatmates Mark and Jez. The writing is fantastic, the POV style camera work is a touch of genius and the characters, particularly the druggy friend Superhans are almost perfect. It is still funny years on, it is still relevant and it still my absolute go to if I want a short 25 minute piece of TV to cheer me up or to watch whilst eating takeaway.   </p>

                <h1>Hannibal</h1>
            </a>
            <p>Hannibal (2013 - 2015) divided viewers. Some thought it was a poor imitation of the much loved films, others thought it was a work of mastery. I am, obviously, in the latter. Mads Mikkelsen is a brilliant young Hannibal Lecter and the intense focus on the psychological aspects are what kept me coming back for more and more. The extreme gore was not enough to put me off tuning in each and every week and already having rewatched it twice.</p>

                <h1> Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons</h1>
            </a>
            <p>Captain Scarlett and the Mysterons (1967 -1968) was the most "grown up" of the puppet shows by Gerry Anderson. Whereas Thunderbirds and Stingray were most definitely aimed at the younger audience, Captain Scarlett had a darker side that appealed as a child. I had the toys, I had all the videos. I still go back and watch some of the episodes when I'm feeling nostalgic and Captain Black still sends shivers down my spine..</p>
