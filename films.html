                <h1>Ghost Dog</h1>
            </a>
                <p>Ghost Dog (1991) is a hybrid spiritual crime drama directed by Jim Jamusch. My Dad showed it to me when I was too young to understand it fully, but I was strongly drawn to the Samurai imagery throughout the film and quickly realised it was a lot more than an American Mafia drama. Ghost Dog weaves deep Japanese culture into a modern gritty thriller. Forest Whitaker is sublime.

                <h1> Pulp Fiction</h1>
            </a>
            <p>Pulp Fiction (1994). Where do you start? What is there to say?  One of the greatest films ever made and still Tarantino's finest effort. Non-linear narrative, quotes that are still funny and pertinent today, acting masterclasses from Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta and a soundtrack unrivalled as a multi-genre classic to this day. Two gangsters looking after a briefcase for their boss takes iconic twist after iconic turn.  </p>

                <h1>Oldboy</h1>
            </a>
            <p>Oldboy (2003) was relatively unknown when I first came across it. An American remake was made more recently that was okay, just not a patch on the original. It's sick, it's twisted, it's Korean. A man is kidnapped and imprisoned for years with no idea by whom and for what crime. When he is released, he spends his whole life trying to figure out the answers. I've never been so shocked at an ending to this day.

                <h1> Lost in Translation</h1>
            </a>
            <p>Lost in Translation (2003) is far slower and more gentle than the other three, but just as fantastic. I have always loved  subtle, melancholy and dialogue driven films and Lost in Translation is the perfect example. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanssen are masterful. They are both in a Japanese hotel, reluctantly, for completely different reasons. Their solitude, loneliness and introspective outlooks bring them together in the most poignant way possible. </p>
