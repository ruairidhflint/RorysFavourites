            <h1>Rory's Favourites</h1>
            <p>I'm Rory. That's me on the right. It has come to my attention
                that apparently everything is my favouite. If I like something new, 
                I declare it my favourite. The Streets are my favourite, Johnny Cash is my
                favourite, that one song I heard once on the radio is my favourite song of 
                all time. The film last night was my favourite. So is Pulp Fiction.
                This trend disturbs me and undermines my place in the world as an authentic
                and top tier cultural critic. This website sets out, in stone (sort of), my
                <strong> actual</strong> favourites. These are the best. These are the time
                tested classics that I am unable to be swayed from by the latest chart entry.
                This is Doomsday book of my opinion. The record has been set.
